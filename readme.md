# Flask-tempalte-project

This is a template that helped me speed up the head work when building flask apps.

Out of the box, this template supports 3 types of deploying your app:

1. **test server - popular "app.run"**
2. **deploying to Heroku**
3. **building & deploying a docker image**


Also, app is preloaded with bootstrap 3.
