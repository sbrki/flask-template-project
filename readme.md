# Flask-template-project

This is a template that helps me speed up the head work when building flask apps.
It is ideal for small projects and/or hackathons.
I do not advise you to use this template in its original state for more serious projects.

Out of the box, this template supports 4 types of deploying your app:

1. **test server - popular "app.run()"**
2. **running with gunicorn** 
3. **deploying to Heroku**
4. **building & deploying a docker image**


Also, app is preloaded with bootstrap 3.
